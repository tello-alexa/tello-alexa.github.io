# My Portfolio
Howdy! This is the repository for my personal website, noting my past roles, projects, and more. This personal website is currently linked on my resume and LinkedIn profiles, so it is the utmost importance to me the information on here is up to date!
Like most software in this age, this website is still a work in progress. With content and stylistic updates to come, stop by to see what I add on here next!
