          <h2>Past Service</h2>
          <p>I spent three years in high school assisting teachers during my lunch period by helping them grade papers, organize or clean classrooms after dealing with notably rambunctious students. Eventually, I was accepted into my high school's chapter of the <a href="https://www.nhs.us/">National Honor Society</a>, where we were focused on supporting people in our community by hosting various events throughout the year. Below are some of the most memorable ones:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Teacher's Pageant - a traditional pageant competition between teachers where all funds from the event were donated to local veterans.</li>
              <li>Holiday Party - an annual event for special education students and their families to celebrate the holidays with games and treats.</li>
              <li>Trunk-or-Treat - a safe environment for families to trick-or-treat that also acted as a fundraiser to fight homelessness.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Another organization I've worked with is <a href="https://www.forloveandart.org/">For Love & Art</a>, non-profit that allows people with limited mobility to have the art gallery experience from the comfort of their homes. It was because of my volunteering with this organization that I became fond of the elderly as I visited retirement homes and individual families to look through and discuss art.</p>
          <h2>Hopeful Service</h2>
          <p>Last year, my quarantine activity of choice became knitting after messing with my sister's starter kit she hadn't touched, but since then it's become a bit of a hobby of mine. Because of this, I am hoping to contribute to Aggie Knitting, Crafting, and More (<a href="http://aggiekcam.weebly.com/">Aggie KCAM</a>), a community service organization that helps the Bryan-College Station area by making scarves, gloves and other apparel for those in need. I am hoping that during my senior year that I can be a part of Big Event, the largest student-run service project in the United States and hosted by Texas A&M University aiming to show students' appreciation for the community by helping out local residents.</p>
