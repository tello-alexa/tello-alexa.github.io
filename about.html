            <h2>From the Top</h2>
            <p>My name is Alexa Tello and I am a junior Computer Science major studying at <a href="https://tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a>. I am hoping to start a career dealing with my interests in data science and meteorology. While my family and I are originally from New Jersey, I consider myself from Fort Worth, Texas since it’s where I’ve been most of my life. In my off time, I enjoy casual gaming, discussing anything about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and spending time with my twin sister Amanda (shown to the left of the photo).</p>

        <!-- About Me Paragraphs --> 
        <h2>What Got Me Here</h2>
        <p>What first brought computer science to my attention was in high school when my school district introduced a handful of courses my sophomore year. At first, I took the class because I was curious about game development; but over time, I anticipated every day of class because I felt like I was truely learning useful knowledge and creating neat things along the way. Now at Texas A&M, I've learned eight different programming languages and counting, in addition to being exposed to different facets of computer science. I am also in the process of earning a minor in meteorology, a subject I have been casually interested in for some time, my family joking that I'd become a meteorologist after recounting weather reports so many times. I also took this interest a bit more seriously in high school when I showcased a project to my physics class about AI identifying hurricanes through satellite images with help from ordinary people through <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">citizen science</a>. Currently, I am taking courses in computer systems (using Linux), software engineering and severe weather.</p>
         
        <h2>Beyond My Courses</h2>
        <p>While my coursework has given me both breadth in my skills and a specific path I'd like to take with my career, one of the most valuable experiences I've had at Texas A&M so far is my job for the <a href="https://oal.tamu.edu">Open Access Labs</a>, a job I've had for about a year and a half now. I first started as a Student Assistant there in the summer of 2019, and I was geting used to walking to the twenty-two locations we serviced at the time. Though, the real learning curve was the beginning of the fall semester that year, where it was peak season for students printing thousands of pages each day and our team was still understaffed from half of the team graduating the spring before. There were times during these weeks where I worked completely alone and was quite literally running back and forth across campus, particularly between Evans Library and the Memorial Student Center, to keep everything afloat. Slowly, the team started to grow with new members, and it made me realize the value that a team can bring. With a capable team, not only can they achieve more as a unit, but they can depend on each other when they need to.</p>
        <p>Another lesson I gained when I started at the Open Access Labs was how communication can make a team more capable than they already are. Growing up, I was often looked upon as a leader by example, always doing what I had to, but a quiet one at that. There have been many days when there was not much that needed to be done, so my teammates and I would often sit in silence waiting for something to go wrong. Wanting to fill the void but having no clue what to talk about, I brought up some of the random holidays on my calendar or <a href="https://www.checkiday.com/">other sources</a>. To my surprise, they seemed to enjoy it, prompting them to talk about some of their own personal experiences I wouldn’t have known otherwise, and it’s become part of my routine ever since. It was because of those ice breakers that I was able to connect with my team, while also encouraging me to be more vocal about our tasks at hand. Now as a Student Leader, I am one of the first to welcome my coworkers old and new and direct our game plan for what needs to be done each day.</p>
